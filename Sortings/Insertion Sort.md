# Insertion sort
It is a sorting method which set the second element as key, then compare it to the first element, if the first element is greater than key, place the key at the first place. Then keep taking the 3rd, 4th...element as key and 
compare one by one to the previous element, finally sort it.

<br>Space Complexity - O(1)
